## Download
If you already have Java 1.8 installed you can download it from  [here[NoJRE]](https://tgi.seemslegit.me/launcher/download/NoJRE/UltimateGameLauncher.zip).

Otherwise you can download it from [here[JRE]](https://tgi.seemslegit.me/launcher/download/JRE/UltimateGameLauncher.zip) with a portable version of Java, so you don't have to install Java.

#### Installation
1. When you downloaded the zip file, extract it into a folder where you want to install the launcher.
2. Start the **updater.bat** file and all files will be downloaded.
3. When the Updater is finished, close the console and start the **Launcher.jar** by double clicking it or create a Batch file for it.
All batch files can be found in the [Batch folder](https://github.com/BubbleEgg/UltimateGameLauncher/tree/master/batch).

#### Updates
The Updater keeps your launcher up-to-date. It automatically checks for 
updates when you start the **Launcher.jar**. If you want to disable it, 
add `--noUpdate` to the start options.
e.g:
```
JRE:  jre\bin\java.exe -jar Launcher.jar --noUpdate
NoJRE:  java -jar Launcher.jar --noUpdate
```
